# Array and ArrayList Operations in Java

## Overview
This repository contains Java programs that demonstrate various array operations, including:
- Segregating even and odd numbers into separate arrays.
- Finding two neighboring numbers with the smallest difference in an array.
- Converting an array to an `ArrayList` and vice versa.

## Files and Structure
The repository consists of the following Java files:

1. **Main.java**  
   - Acts as the entry point of the program.  
   - Calls functions for user input, segregation, min-difference pair detection, and array conversions.

2. **UserInput.java**  
   - Contains a method to accept an array of integers from the user.

3. **ArrayOperations.java**  
   - Implements functions for:
     - Segregating even and odd numbers.
     - Finding the index of the first number in a pair with the smallest difference.
     - Converting an array to an `ArrayList` and back.
